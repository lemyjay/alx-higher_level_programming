# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

Went a little deep on classes and objects in python:
- class attributes
- static method
- dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- __str__ and __repr__; what they are, when and how to use them
- difference between an object attribute and a class attribute
- how to bind attributes to objects and classes
- how to use the gettattr function
	and a whole lot.
